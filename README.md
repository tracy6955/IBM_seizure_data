# seizure-type-classification-tuh-modification

In this repo, it generated pre-processed dataset for TUH seizure detection which has been used in the below paper:
["SeizureNet: Multi-Spectral Deep Feature Learning for Seizure Type Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03232)

For more details, please refer to: `data_preparation`
The code repository is sourced from the github repo ('https://github.com/IBM/seizure-type-classification-tuh'), we made several edits so that the code could be used to detect seizures (whether EEG data contains seizure), while the original post removed non-seizure entries, it only keeps those containing seizures.
